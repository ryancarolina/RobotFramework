# Install robotframework using python3 pip
python3 -m pip install robotframework\
# Install and upgrade the selenium2library
pip3 install --upgrade robotframework-selenium2library\
# Install WebDriver Manager to help with installing required browser drivers
pip3 install webdrivermanager\
# Install the chrome driver and create a symlink to /usr/local/bin
webdrivermanager chrome --linkpath /usr/local/bin

I am developing my tests in the IDE PyCharm as it has plugin support for the RobotFramework, however other options like ATOM will work.
